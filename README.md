üìä <h2>LEGO Data Analysis: Price Trends, Set Complexity, and Market Evolution</h2>
**Welcome to my first data analysis project and visualization in Looker!** üöÄ 
This repository presents my exploration of historical LEGO data, including an analysis of price trends, set complexity, and their correlation over the years. Through this project, I aim to demonstrate my skills in data visualization and storytelling, while uncovering fascinating insights about one of the world‚Äôs most iconic brands.

üß© **Key Insights**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ *Non-linear Price Trends*
LEGO‚Äôs average set prices over the decades reveal intriguing patterns:  
2002‚Äì2004: Noticeable price peaks, with a significant dip in 2003.
*Why the fluctuations?*
Historical research shows that 2003 was a year of financial crisis for LEGO. The years 2004‚Äì2006 marked a period of recovery and restructuring, which propelled LEGO to market leadership.

2Ô∏è‚É£ *Growing Set Complexity: More Pieces Over Time*  
The average number of pieces per LEGO set is growing almost exponentially, indicating:  
A focus on creating more intricate, immersive designs.  
An evolution in consumer expectations, favoring more challenging and rewarding building experiences.  
LEGO‚Äôs innovation-driven approach to meeting customer needs.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ *Correlation Between Price and Number of Pieces* 
Analyzing the relationship between price and the number of pieces:    
Up to $250: A strong correlation exists ‚Äì higher prices generally mean more pieces.     
Beyond $250: The correlation weakens. Why? Prices in this range are influenced by additional factors, such as:    
Licensing costs (e.g., Star Wars, Marvel),  
Collectible value, especially in limited editions,  
Unique designs in premium sets (e.g., "Landmarks" or "Stadiums").
