📊 LEGO Data Analysis: Price Trends, Set Complexity, and Market Evolution
Welcome to my first data analysis project! 🚀 This repository presents my exploration of historical LEGO data, including an analysis of price trends, set complexity, and their correlation over the years. Through this project, I aim to demonstrate my skills in data visualization and storytelling, while uncovering fascinating insights about one of the world’s most iconic brands.

🧩 Key Insights
1️⃣ Non-linear Price Trends
LEGO’s average set prices over the decades reveal intriguing patterns:

2002–2004: Noticeable price peaks, with a significant dip in 2003.
Why the fluctuations? Historical research shows that 2003 was a year of financial crisis for LEGO. The years 2004–2006 marked a period of recovery and restructuring, which propelled LEGO to market leadership.
2️⃣ Growing Set Complexity: More Pieces Over Time
The average number of pieces per LEGO set is growing almost exponentially, indicating:

A focus on creating more intricate, immersive designs.
An evolution in consumer expectations, favoring more challenging and rewarding building experiences.
LEGO’s innovation-driven approach to meeting customer needs.
3️⃣ Correlation Between Price and Number of Pieces
Analyzing the relationship between price and the number of pieces:

Up to $250: A strong correlation exists – higher prices generally mean more pieces.
Beyond $250: The correlation weakens. Why? Prices in this range are influenced by additional factors, such as:
Licensing costs (e.g., Star Wars, Marvel),
Collectible value, especially in limited editions,
Unique designs in premium sets (e.g., "Landmarks" or "Stadiums").
🛠 Tools and Technologies
Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data analysis and visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: The environment for developing this analysis.
PDF and CSV Files: Sources of historical LEGO data.
📈 What’s Next?
This project is the beginning of my journey into data analytics. Next steps include:

Extending the analysis to include sales data.
Investigating regional and demographic trends in LEGO purchases.
Applying advanced predictive models to forecast future trends.
